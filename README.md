# Design Patterns

## OOP Concepts
1. **Abstraction**
   - is the concept of hiding the implementation and un-necessary details or data from the user.
   - It's the process of hiding complexity and focusing on what functionalities are available to use.
   - Can be done using abstract classes and interfaces.
   - You can achieve the SRP as you separate all data and its responsibilities in different entities.
2. **Encapsulation**
   - is the concept of wrapping data and code as single unit.

    | Abstraction                                                                | Encapsulation                                                                                        |
    |----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | solves the issues at the design level.                                     | solves it in the implementation level                                                                |
    | is about hiding unwanted details while showing most essential information. | means binding the code and data into a single unit.                                                  |
    | allows focusing on what the information object must contain.               | means hiding the internal details or mechanics of how an object does something for security reasons. |
3. **Inheritance**
   - is the concept in which one object acquires/inherits all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
   - Code to an abstraction/interface rather than a concrete class (avoid loosely coupled classes).
   - Favor composition over inheritance.
4. **Polymorphism**
   - is the concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
   - is derived from 2 Greek words:
     - **poly** means many,
     - and **morphs** means forms.
   - so, polymorphism means many forms.
   - has 2 types:
     - static.
     - dynamic.
